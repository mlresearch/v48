title: Nonparametric Canonical Correlation Analysis
abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical representation learning
  technique for finding correlated variables in multi-view data. Several nonlinear
  extensions of the original linear CCA have been proposed, including kernel and deep
  neural network methods. These approaches seek maximally correlated projections among
  families of functions, which the user specifies (by choosing a kernel or neural
  network structure), and are computationally demanding. Interestingly, the theory
  of nonlinear CCA, without functional restrictions, had been studied in the population
  setting by Lancaster already in the 1950s, but these results have not inspired practical
  algorithms. We revisit Lancaster’s theory to devise a practical algorithm for nonparametric
  CCA (NCCA). Specifically, we show that the solution can be expressed in terms of
  the singular value decomposition of a certain operator associated with the joint
  density of the views. Thus, by estimating the population density from data, NCCA
  reduces to solving an eigenvalue system, superficially like kernel CCA but, importantly,
  without requiring the inversion of any kernel matrix. We also derive a partially
  linear CCA (PLCCA) variant in which one of the views undergoes a linear projection
  while the other is nonparametric. Using a kernel density estimate based on a small
  number of nearest neighbors, our NCCA and PLCCA algorithms are memory-efficient,
  often run much faster, and perform better than kernel CCA and comparable to deep
  CCA.
