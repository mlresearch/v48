title: Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks
abstract: Modeling the distribution of natural images is a landmark problem in unsupervised
  learning. This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable
  and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels
  in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability
  of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image.
  Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective
  use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood
  scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of
  the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset.
  Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.
